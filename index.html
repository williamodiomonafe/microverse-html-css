       Nelson Mandela International Day 2018 marks 100 years since the birth of Nelson Mandela (18 July 1918). The Centenary is an occasion to reflect on his life and legacy, and to follow his call to "make of the world a better place." The memory of the first President of post-apartheid South Africa stands tall as a beacon of equal rights the world over, owing to his rigorous pursuit of a South African society bereft of the evils of racial segregation. Reminiscing Mandela’s ideas stands especially relevant today as the world once again witnesses the resurgence of the politics of fear and the brandishing of the “other”. The occasion’s significance stands elevated as 2018 is also the 125th anniversary of M.K. Gandhi being thrown out of a train at Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. In hindsight, that instance in distant South Africa bore great significance for the destinies of millions in South Asia, as it was that particular moment of humiliation which inspired the then-young Indian barrister to return to his country, and fight the British colonialists.
